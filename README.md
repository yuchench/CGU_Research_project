Instructor: Wen-Piao Lin

Student: Po-Chun Chen, Cheng-Pei Wu, Yu-Chen Chueh

This thesis project is about building up a system that can simultaneously get users' position information and transmit it back to the database.

We believe this project contains tremendous potential benefits in the medical aspects, IoT systems, and others industries.

This is the main reason why we spent lots of time on this project.
